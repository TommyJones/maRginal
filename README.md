marginal will be an R package for calculating marginal effects for arbitrary prediction models. As of now, code and research are in early stages. 

Open issues include:

* Finding a valid way to calculate confidence intervals
* Handling categorical variables more elegantly
* Finding the best default behaviors for calculations
* And more!
